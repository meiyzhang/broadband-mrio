# MRIO Modeling for Environmental Analysis of Broadband Infrastructure Expansion

The deployment of universal broadband infrastructure is heralded as a catalyst for societal progress and economic development. However, coupled with rapid globalization and industrialization in the past few decades, the environmental implications of infrastructure expansion remain largely unstudied. This paper employs multi-regional input-output (MRIO) modeling to quantify environmental effects across global regions to elucidate upon the effects and implications of various broadband expansion policies. By integrating sector-specific data from the internationally compiled Eora dataset and environmental accounts, we construct a comprehensive MRIO network to trace direct and indirect environmental impacts through global supply chains. Utilizing the Leontief inverse matrix, we furthermore calculate the total requirements of each sector, capturing both the immediate and secondary environmental burdens associated with broadband infrastructure expansion. By applying scenario analysis, we assess the implications of different broadband expansion policies under varying assumptions and conditions. Ultimately, this paper seeks to provide policymakers with empirically grounded insight to optimize future investments in infrastructure whilst fostering environmental productivity and responsibility.
